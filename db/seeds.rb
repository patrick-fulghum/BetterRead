Nothing demysticizes like familiarity, and this book is full of precise descriptions of his monstrous creatures, their histories, their habits--Lovecraft even spends a few paragraphs telling us how they like to furnish and decorate their living rooms.

The experienced crew are killed when the ship “jumps” into an unexpected space battle during what should have been a routine test, and the young newbies are forced to step up and assume command. Naturally, the guy (Nathan) with the political pedigree and “natural leadership” abilities ends up as captain.
  Cooler than Cameron, though, is Jessica! Wow! Sexual (but hetero, sigh), ambitious and KICK-ASS as a special-ops gal, she rocks as the new head of security!
