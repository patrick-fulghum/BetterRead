There’s really not much to say about this book that hasn’t already been said many times over. It’s a great story, well written, and with a HUGE cast of wonderful characters that I like a lot.

A solid 5 stars for both the book and the audio..",

Then after reading Armada I fully realized what a talentless one-trick hack that Cline really is so I changed this rating. Plus, his outraged hardcore fans kept coming on here and telling me that I missed the point since I didn't give it 5 stars so I might as well give them something to really be mad about. If you're one of those Cline fans who wants to whine about it in the comments I will just delete it and block you.",

The story is well written and original but the writing style was so dry and boring because it's a scientist recording their expedition that I had to drag myself through it. There was just so much detail about things that weren't interesting when all I wanted to know more about was the horrible shit that was happening to them.",

It is meant to be a story of the fantastical, of the supernatural, of mystery and suspense--yet it is full of the very things that kill off any sense of wonder or the uncanny. Nothing demysticizes like familiarity, and this book is full of precise descriptions of his monstrous creatures, their histories, their habits--Lovecraft even spends a few paragraphs telling us how they like to furnish and decorate their living rooms. A tip for writers of the supernatural: if you want a being to be mysterious and unsettling, don't go off on a tangent about its commitment to feng shui.",

It's basically bad Star Trek/Stargate fanfiction written by a teenage David Weber wannabe. A missmash of science fiction tropes, zero logic or consistency, cardboard characterization, absurd coincidences, etc. etc. If you are looking to support a self-published author that can actually write, try Hugh Howey's Wool books. Alternatively, for space opera actually well done, Bujold's Vorkosigan series. But not this. Definitely not this.",

The experienced crew are killed when the ship “jumps” into an unexpected space battle during what should have been a routine test, and the young newbies are forced to step up and assume command. Naturally, the guy (Nathan) with the political pedigree and “natural leadership” abilities ends up as captain.
  Cooler than Cameron, though, is Jessica! Wow! Sexual (but hetero, sigh), ambitious and KICK-ASS as a special-ops gal, she rocks as the new head of security!
  I’m hovering between 3.4-3.6 for my rating….hmmmm flipping a coin…literally!....coin toss says…..4",

There were some parts of the book that I had to re-read, because the scenes were so touching. Like when a certain person dies. Even though you they weren't around very much, you still felt the hurt and pain that Nathan was going through.

The book reminded me a lot of Stargate Universe, but I think that Aurora: CV-01 was much better. I'm definitely going to go purchase the sequel as soon as I finish this review, and devour it as soon as possible!",
